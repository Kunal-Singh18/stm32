## **Overview**  
This project involves writing **bare-metal code** for an **STM32** microcontroller, strictly adhering to the **CMSIS (Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard)** without using external libraries. The goal is to develop a deeper understanding of microcontroller architecture by implementing low-level drivers and system functionalities from scratch.  

## **Features**  
- **Peripheral Configuration:**  
  - GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output)  
  - USART (Universal Synchronous/Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter)  
  - I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)  
  - SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)  
  - DMA (Direct Memory Access)  
  - SysTick Timer (System Timer)  
- **Interrupt Handling:**  
  - Efficient usage of NVIC (Nested Vector Interrupt Controller)  
  - Custom interrupt service routines (ISRs)  
- **Performance Optimization:**  
  - Low-level hardware interactions for minimal latency  
  - Optimized memory usage and power efficiency
